Go on and wring my neck
Like when a rag gets wet
A little discipline for my pet genius
My head is like lettuce
Go on dig your thumbs in
I cannot stop giving
I′m (fifty-) | thirty-something

Sense of security
Like pockets jingling
(Midlife crisis)
Suck ingenuity
Down through the family tree

You're perfect, yes, it′s true
But without me you're only you
(You're only you)
Your menstruating heart
It ain′t bleedin′ enough for two

It's a midlife crisis
It′s a midlife crisis
